# Sync Sound Mobile Application

Built with [React Native v0.40](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.40/).

## Prerequisites

- [node && npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) I recommend using a node verion manager such as
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to make it easy to manage node versions in the future

- [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) A better npm client.

- [React Native Tools](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.40/docs/getting-started.html#content)
Follow the getting started guide.

- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) A linting tool for JavaScript.
You must set your editor of choice up to support eslint. The configuration is already
included in the project.
